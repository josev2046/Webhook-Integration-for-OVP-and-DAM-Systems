# Webhook-Integration-for-OVP-and-DAM-Systems

### Vimeo Webhook Functionality:

Vimeo app webhooks provide instant updates on user actions. Webhooks can therefore enable near real-time notifications of events within an application. By configuring webhooks, you can subscribe to specific events and receive automated notifications via HTTP POST requests to a designated URL.

#### Prerequisites:

* Vimeo Enterprise Account
* Vimeo API Application
* Webhooks Capability (`CAPABILITY_WEBHOOK_SCOPE`)
* Access Token (with `public`, `private`, `edit`, `delete`, and `webhooks` scopes)

#### Configuration:

A webhook's target URL is a user-defined, publicly accessible endpoint.
Vimeo delivers event notifications via HTTP POST requests to this URL.

#### Operation:

##### Create:

POST <https://api.vimeo.com/apps/{app_id}/webhooks>


**Headers:**

Authorization: bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/vnd.vimeo.*+json;version=3.4


**Body:**

  "is_enabled": true,
  "webhook_url": "[https://example.com/webhook](https://example.com/webhook)",

  "secret": "your-secret-key"
}
